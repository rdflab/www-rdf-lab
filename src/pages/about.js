            The Institute for Cancer Genetics was founded in 1999 as part of a
            commitment by Columbia University to examine the molecular
            mechanisms and pathogenesis of cancer.

            Researchers use traditional approaches such as transgenic mice to
            model human cancers and also take advantage of new technology such
            as next generation sequencing to identify and characterize key
            proteins and transcriptional and signaling pathways involved in
            tumor initiation and progression.

            Research in the ICG includes cancer genetics and epigenetics,
            intensive analysis of key protein-protein interactions in oncogenic
            pathways, DNA damage and repair in normal and neoplastic cells, and
            experimental anti-cancer therapeutics.
